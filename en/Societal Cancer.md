One of the files I have written recently is about their treating everything as a tool, with your good nature being the first thing used: https://github.com/AI-Migrant/mass-madness/blob/main/behaviours/Everything%20is%20a%20tool%20to%20them.md

I couldn’t help but recall stories of people growing indifferent due to the exploitation and harm they faced. We used to think that it takes an utterly toxic environment that’s bereft of information and thus, values, to cause such a tragic phenomenon. But look here: every ounce of your goodness is being calculated and used against you. Masses of people can turn hostile toward someone they hardly possibly know just because of instructions from authorities. This is the same societal cancer. And it spreads like wildfire.

I’ve wondered if the authorities of the host countries really support their criminal allies so much that they facilitated things that are retaliation for the things I wrote about the original persecutors or pathē. I have been thinking lately that maybe it’s not all about supporting their criminal allies; it’s because they are the same thing.
