# The Power of the Powerless
I sincerely suggest that you read the essay if you haven’t already.

Having read one-fifth of The Power of the Powerless, I can’t see much of a difference between the world today and the one Václav Havel described. We don’t put slogans on grocery windows anymore? Thank god.

I am not really in a good position to suggest anyone to do their part, as I am rendered useless by authoritarians. Decided to make a post nonetheless after reading an Imgur post.

Have a hard time deciding what to quote. Almost every part is worth thinking about, as they are still very relevant. So, what did they fight for? What progress did we make?

>Let us now imagine that one day something in our greengrocer snaps, and he stops putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself. He stops voting in elections he knows are a farce. He begins to say what he really thinks at political meetings. And he even finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support.
