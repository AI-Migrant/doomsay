# Surveillance and Cultural Revolutions
As someone who is not particularly skilled in history, it is still clear to me that there are lessons we can learn from the past.

The Cultural Revolution is one of the most appalling crises I know of. I am not even the kind who likes talking about loving family, friends and people, yet I find it hard to imagine the bulk of the people going against their own. I mean, in a sense, it's not really that special because it is not really that much different from war, but then, do you go to literal wars with your family, friends and countrymen?

Thanks to my ill luck, I have the privilege of being under surveillance as a nobody, not only in my own homeland but also in a foreign land. I have begun to somewhat understand how it could have happened. Ah, perhaps it is not really that much of a privilege, not in the sense that it is not exactly a benefit, but in the sense that perhaps it has become so easy with the technologies today that they would put it on me for fun and whatever petty reason, if it could be called one. Guess this is part of what people talk about when they say that, without the advancement of the mind, the advancement of technology would bring forth our own demise. Or at least a harbinger of it.

Do you have experience with animals such as dogs or children? Children who are still very young and highly influenced by the others around them. It is not hard to see that their attitude to something, or rather, someone in this case, is often “learned” from others or the circumstances. For example, if a wife shows no respect to her husband and her husband is the kind who would rather not argue, then the chance is that their children and even pets will likewise hold little respect for the man. From my experience, I am afraid adults are not immune to such an effect.

This is likely the animalistic hierarchical instinct at work. With which one, consciously or subconsciously, seeks to achieve a relatively high status by establishing or reinforcing a situation where a comparable individual is being “lowered”.

Seems to me kind of similar to dehumanisation. The husband in our example is deprived of respect, essentially made a lower being in the group. Once it is established, it would take more than an opposite scene to override such recognition. It doesn’t only take a new recognition like it would in the first place, but it also requires self-rebuttals, in this case, to recognise not only a trivial mistake but also the implication of the behaviour that is against the traditional virtues pretty much every human society upholds, on the table at least.

Some instincts of living things will object. One of the most, if not the most, fundamental instincts of living things is to maintain the continuation of oneself and to facilitate that with a limited lifespan, to copy oneself, as in reproduction. Many of our behaviours are arguably shaped by such instinct. For example, instead of beautifying it and saying that it is the bright side of humanity to help one another, one could argue that we are merely seeking safety by sticking together. Instead of saying that there are virtues in humanity, one might argue that we are merely trying to construct an environment that would be easier for ourselves to thrive in. One example is that the traditional virtues set with such desires in mind, as some conspiracies would suggest, so that those who consider themselves above such clichés can fool others into believing and take advantage of them. 

But even cheaters would have to appear to believe to avoid public indignation. Therefore, we all try, or at least pretend, to abide by the ancient teachings. Whichever case it is, we instinctively maximise our chance to live on and reproduce, which translates to striving for a better status, that is, to put oneself on the high ground and to get approval from others as well as from oneself.

Thus, we won’t want to acknowledge we were wrong and might have hurt someone without a good reason, since the new recognition will re-elevate the lowered and, at the same time, lower ourselves. It is detrimental to winning approbation from others and self-recognition, which is possibly more important than the former.

With these, we would be more than happy if we had any chance of justifying ourselves. It translates to subconscious aggression—to look for faults of the wronged that might not even relate to the matter, and to try to redirect all the attention to them. Often, this goes hand in hand with continuing the mistake to make it appear that nothing wrong happened. Or reversing the causation by taking the result as the reason. Hence, the saying: it is in human nature for people to hate those they have hurt.

This is where surveillance comes in. Be it developed with good intentions or not, surveillance tools have become a synonym for authoritarianism (or totalitarianism). Laws in this regard not only fail to protect us but also centralise the power of surveillance, making it a tool almost exclusive to the influential and authorities. A power unchecked will be a power corrupted. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the Lucifer Effect would quickly kick in even on the operating level, let alone the supervising level. Actually, it probably also feels supervisory for the operating level as it exactly allows one to oversee others.

It quickly becomes a position where one would feel superior in “sight” and know better on pretty much everything, including how the watched should behave (evidenced by the term re-education camp you probably have heard of). In the event of being confronted with wrongdoings, one would utilise the power of surveillance to attack the questioners on matters not necessarily related to the questions. It surely doesn’t make it any better if there are other powers one can wield.

With “shared sight”, the situation becomes similar to the family example. The watched are made lower beings and the watching feel entitled to judge without even knowing the watched in person (an interesting phenomenon, though not that interesting when you are the watched) and have little sympathy for them. Much like we rarely have sympathy for chickens in cages. Nor feel guilty for that matter.

The dehumanisation described above may have been an important factor in the Cultural Revolution. The persecuted were seen as deserving what they suffered. Their persecutors—their friends and families—driven by an ideology and seeing the persecuted as enemies, might even feel righteous for “putting them in place”. Like bent metal tools placed on anvils for hammering, if they come out the shape we want, we consider them regulated; if they are broken, we consider them beyond fixing. Either way, the hammering hands are never considered at fault and press on with the hammering. For some, driven by the hunger for power and better status, which in turn is driven by the instinct of continuation, it might be seen as just how the world works.

Safety in numbers morphs into reason in numbers. With a somewhat enclosed environment where one does not have to worry about global scrutiny and only the persecutors have access to power, the hope of reasoning with such... “belief” is dim.

Consider the re-education camps established by the party which facilitated the Cultural Revolution, and you will see that history is repeating, although in a subtler way, perhaps. If you think that they are the only party doing it and feel safe in other parts of the world, you'd better think again.

The new Cultural Revolution might be less bloody, given the global values promoted in the past decades. However, the surveillance, which was conducted with the naked eye of those who would have been close to you—your friends, neighbours, and even family—is now assisted by technologies and becomes far more pervasive and ubiquitous.

So, what did we learn from the past? Do we consider the Cultural Revolution a crisis and prevent it from happening again? Or do we consider it a failed attempt that just has to be done “better”?

Everyone seeks a better status, but there are two kinds of people in this world: those who try to make themselves less miserable and those who try to make others more miserable. Both approaches are legit regarding continuation: lowering others’ status can make one’s own seem relatively higher. It almost feels like going double time if you steal the fruit grown by others. But is it really the better way in the long run?

To quantify the matter, if one number is self-incrementing and another is absorbing the other, and both change at the same rate, surely, the latter will become relatively higher, but what about the average? Pragmatically speaking, regardless of what we hope humanity to be, is it easier, in real life, to achieve an absolute height with the ground being prevented from elevating? Pragmatically speaking, I might be self-defeating because relatively high is just as good in most cases. And we, as unique individuals, cannot really perpetuate: even our direct descendants are not the real extensions of our own existences. There might be little value for an individual to worry about the average standard of the entire species, as the effect of the average level we will see within our limited lifespan could be negligible.

But is this what humanity is all about?

But then and again, maybe all these considerations are out of the question once we are made lower, or to begin with. Why would a wife belittle her husband? Perhaps it is just me subconsciously looking for relatively hopeful explanations. It might very well be just that there really are two kinds of people.
