# Authoritarian Methods
Methods that are employed by authoritarians. It is not a worry of the falling sky. It is upon us way before we realise.

You might also be aware of these already. There are probably many more, but at least this can be a reminder or basic checklist.

Basically, you can expect maliciousness from anyone, for everyone could be corrupted. But some traditionally highly respected professions might be worth mentioning, e.g. (fake or real): teachers, doctors, social workers, government staff, police, lawyers, judges, and last but not least, reporters.

Instead of thinking people won't be so immoral, you'd better expect them to feel professional and powerful.

We should keep in mind the abuse of surveillance when considering the possible effects of any of the other powers.

**Monopolizing power**
1. Weapon, firearms  
   self-explained
2. Law and Rights  
   ever experienced crimes but found records, such as CCTV records, inaccessible?
3. Media  
   This one is huge; it is not just fake information, it is not even just selected information for you. Sometimes it just needs to show on your screen.  
   Also, neutralise criticism with “different viewing points” and rewrite history posteriorly.
4. Surveillance  
   Your digital devices, social platforms, people that reasonably appear in your daily life and CCTV. And then there are hidden cameras, which are already gross, but what if some military-grade items are also used?    Yes, against you and me, the common people.  
   Constant surveillance also helps form tactics and narratives.
5. Facilities  
   Medical facilities, entertainment, education, you name it.
6. Social support  
   Both emotional and material.
7. Life necessities  
   Import and export restrictions by instructing or commanding merchants.

**Social Engineering**
1. Direct  
   personal data, not just for direct attacks but also to set up further data extraction and, literally, to set you up.
2. Indirect  
   (fake) friendship, romance (love), sex (lust), family and others, e.g., kids, animals  
   Repeat by changing actors (I am serious) when fail. “You cannot hate the whole world because the last person was bad, can you?”
3. Status: career, wealth and power  
   opportunity and convenience
4. Social pressure  
   E.g., peer sanctioning and conformity

**Psychological Warfare (mostly self-explained)**
1. Infiltrating the mass  
   - Sway the direction or decision
   - Stir up discord
   - Spread fears
   - Wear down spirit and trust with fake information
2. Dominating the media  
   - Isolate people from different places
   - Induce hesitation  
      by controlling narratives of who is lawful and/or morally correct
   - Crushing faith in prospective support

**Double standard**
1. Moral
2. Law  
   not the subconscious but the calculated ones. Intentionally support and advocate but consider oneself above some norms

**Exploit good natures (self-explained)**
1. Exploit kindness
2. Exploit the senses of honour and duty
3. Exploit bonds between people
